<h2>Family-owned</h2>

We take pride in fostering long term relationships with our customers, having serviced approximately a quarter of our customers for over ten years.</p>

<p>We are known to give excellent customer service, answering phone calls as they come in, and returning all calls and emails within twenty four hours. We custom tailor our clients’ requests to develop an individual landscaping program that is unique to their needs.</p>
<h2>Still Growing</h2>
<p>We have grown steadily each of the eighteen years we have been in business. We now employ over twenty five employees, some of whom have been with the company since Franco American Mowing began.  We are one hundred percent committed to serving our clients, and we promise to be punctual, honest, dependable and to treat customers’ properties as we would our own.</p>
