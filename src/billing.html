<h2 class="text-center">Invoices</h2>

<p>At Franco American Mowing, all services are performed through completion of the job, and then an invoice is generated. Invoices are either sent out by regular postal mail, or are emailed to customers if they prefer.</p>

<p>Lawn Mowing services are billed on a monthly basis; invoices are sent out at the end of each month that has just been completed. If you would like your invoices to be emailed to you each month instead of being sent in the regular mail, please call the office to set that up.</p>

<p>Landscaping services, including Yard Clean-ups, Mulching, Bush Trimming, Planting/Bed Preparation, Aeration/Seeding and Leaf Removal, are billed upon completion of service, and prompt payment is then expected. As with our mowing services, invoices can be either emailed or sent out by regular mail.</p>
