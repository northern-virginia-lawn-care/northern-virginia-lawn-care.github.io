Franco American Mowing offers the service of Aerating & Seeding to its customers.

We believe the best time to aerate and seed your lawn is in the Fall. Doing it during this season will give time for the roots of the grass to strengthen and be mature enough to withstand the heat of the Summer.

We use a newish form of tall fescue grass seed, which is pretreated with "Grosmart technology", resulting in quicker germination and greener, healthier grass.

We recommend to our ongoing customers to get their lawn aerated and seeded every other year, assuming their lawn is in condition.
