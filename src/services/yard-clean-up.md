Yard Clean-ups are typically done in the Spring, once the weather turns mild. However, Franco American Mowing will do clean-ups at customersâ€™ request anytime during the calendar year; for example when customers have just moved into their new home, or after a big storm.

Our "Spring Clean-up" is usually performed in March or April, when a customer wants to get their lawn ready for the Spring season.

It consists of:

- Cleaning up all yard debris leftover from the Winter (including all sticks and leaves)
- Cutting back all dead perennial foliage
- Cutting down liriopes (if any exist) before new growth emerges.

Clean-ups (as well as any of our other Landscaping services) are scheduled on a first come, first serve basis, starting in the beginning of March, weather permitting.
